# Real Estate Price Prediction using Flask
## About the Project
This is a Flask-based web application that predicts real estate prices based on user inputs such as area type, location, size (number of bedrooms), total square feet, number of bathrooms, and balconies. The app uses a trained machine learning model (to be integrated) for predictions.

Users can input details about a property through a form, and the app will display the predicted price along with the model's accuracy (dummy data for now).
## Features
- User-friendly web interface for data input.
- Real-time price prediction based on user inputs.
- Displays model accuracy (currently hardcoded as a placeholder).
- Built using Flask for backend and Python for logic.
## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- NumPy
- Pickle (if using a saved model)

Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install flask numpy
